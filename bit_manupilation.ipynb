    "Considering the range from 1 to N is equivalent to the range from 0 to N, we can analyze the count of set bits by examining each bit position individually.\n",
    "When counting the set bits from 0 to N in the binary representation of numbers, we can observe a repeating pattern at the units place. The pattern consists of a window size of 2, with the sequence \"01\" repeating. At the next place, the window size doubles to 4, and the pattern becomes \"0011\". This pattern continues for each subsequent bit position.\n",

    "To calculate the count of set bits for the complete repetitions of the window, we multiply the number of complete repetitions, which is (N+1)/d, by the count of set bits in each repetition, which is d/2. This gives us ((N+1)/d)*(d/2) set bits from the complete repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining part, which is (N+1)%d, we know that the first d/2 bits are always zeros. To obtain the count of set bits in the remaining part, we subtract d/2 from (N+1)%d. However, if (N+1)%d is less than d/2, it results in a negative number. To avoid this, we take the maximum of ((N+1)%d - d/2) and 0, ensuring a non-negative count.\n",
    "\n",
